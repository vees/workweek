# Workweek Calculator

In remote-work covid times it was tough to figure out if I was meeting or exceeding the hour goals of my day. This project works alongside a hosted API to Toggl that reports the number of minutes logged across all projects and whether tracking is currently active. It does not talk directly to the Toggl API. Although writing a small API to do the calculations in Javascript would not be very difficult, I already had one written in Python to do the math and rounding.
